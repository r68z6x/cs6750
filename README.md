1. One reason why we adjust for the change in net working capital when we calculate cash flows is:
a) Because in most cases “receivables collected” is equal to “sales book” and “expenses paid” is equal to “expenses incurred”.
b) Because “sales” and “expenses” obtained from the firm’s income statements are typically not equal to “cash flows”.
c) Because we need to adjust for depreciation.
d) Because a positive change in net working capital from one year to the other reflects a cash inflow.
e) Because we need to adjust for investments in fixed assets (e.g., buildings, machines, etc.).
2. Precise Corp. is considering the acquisition of a new CNC machine. The NPV of this acquisition project is $2.5 million and the project has an IRR of 14%. To calculate those numbers, you assumed a CCA rate of 30%. It turns out that you were wrong regarding the CCA rate, and that the correct CCA rate that applies to this type of machine is 40%.

a) NPV decreases, IRR decreases
b) NPV decreases, IRR increases
c) NPV increases, IRR decreases
d) NPV increases, IRR increases
e) NPV does not change, IRR does not change

Use the following information to answer Multiple Choice Problems 11 to 15:
Cenex Inc. reported earnings-per-share of $4 this year. Mr. Beauford, the CEO of Cenex, pays 60% of earnings as dividends every year.

a) $27.3
b) $40.0
c) $45.5
d) $50.0
e) $83.3
13. Ann King, the CFO of Cenex, is evaluating an expansion project. She expects that this expansion project would require an initial investment in one year (t = 1) of $2.5/share and would result in additional annual cash flows of $1.5/share over the next ten years starting in two years from now (at t = 2 to t = 11). The opportunity cost of capital for this project is 11% (EAR). By how much would the price of one Cenex share increase today if Cenex decides to undertake this project?
a) $5.7
b) $6.3
c) $8.0
d) $11.3
e) Cenex should not undertake that project because its NPV is negative.
14. Going back to the initial case, Mr. Beauford is worried that the current payout policy of paying out 60% of earnings as dividends is not the optimal choice for Cenex shareholders. He therefore hires the Payout Consulting Group. The first question the consultants ask is how big the ROE (i.e., the return on reinvested earnings) of Cenex is. Remember, Cenex dividends will grow at a rate of 5% per year for the foreseeable future.
a) 5.0%
b) 8.3%
c) 11.0%
d) 12.5%
e) 20.0%
15. The Payout Consulting Group believes that it would be in the best interest of shareholders if Mr. Beauford would decrease the payout ratio from 60% to 25%. They also evaluated the potential of future investment projects and estimate that future projects will earn 12% (i.e., Cenex’s ROE is 12%) for the foreseeable future. Based on this information, what would be the annual growth rate of Cenex’s dividends?
a) 3%
b) 9%
c) 11%
d) 12%
e) Dividends would not grow.
Use the following information to answer Multiple Choice Problems 16 to 23:
Future Electronics Corp. (FEC) is considering the purchase of an additional assembly line for their new smartphone. The new assembly line costs $1 million (at t = 0) and can be sold for $115,000 at the end of its expected 4-year operating life. The new assembly line would increase the annual output capacity from currently 750,000 to 950,000 smartphones per year (at t = 1 to t = 4). FEC estimates to earn $10 per smartphone, calculated as sales less operating expenses (not including taxes, depreciation, or adjustments for net working capital). A study conducted by an independent consulting firm estimates that FEC will be able to lower net working capital by $50,000 when the new assembly line is installed (at t = 0), and that net working capital will increase again by $50,000 at the end of the machine’s operating life (at t = 4). The fee for this study amounts to $18,000 and is due today. The new assembly line belongs to asset class 43 with a CCA rate of 30%. FEC’s required rate of return is 12%, and FEC’s corporate tax rate is 35%.
